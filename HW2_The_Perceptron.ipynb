This allows a more nuancedrepresentation of a particular model to be used when inputting a code snippet. It uses the prediction as either 0 or 1 depending on whether the result is greater than 0.5The reason for using the perceptron function is because of a persistent problem with the perceptron output.

Although increasing the amount of training dataset improves the accuracy and generalizability of the model, it becomes stable at some point. Thus, the complete training dataset is not required, but the selected dataset must be clean and noise-free.\n",

One possibility is to add data to the training dataset, and the added data may be noisy or dirty, making the model slow and difficult to process. Another reason is the lower learning rate, which can make the model converge more slowly or get stuck in local minima.\n",

Tuning this hyperparameter, such as grid search and random search, can also affect the accuracy of the model..\n",

This might lead to the issue of overfitting the model basically this can be that it trains the information rather than generalizing the inconspicuous dataset.
